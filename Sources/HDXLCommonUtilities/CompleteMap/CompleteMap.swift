/// Protocol capturing the *concept* of a "complete dictionary".
/// 
/// Yes, this is *essentially* just a function at heart, but it communicates the *intent* to act like a lookup table.
///
/// For a motivating use-case, consider something like SwiftUI wherein you have a view that has an enumeration
/// of its possible states, and which image-and-color get shown are functions of that state: in `.foo` you show `.fooImage`,
/// in `.bar` you show `.barImage`, and so on. For simple enable/disabled flags an inline ternary works,
/// but as states get more complicated you can write helper methods like `image(forState:)`, but then unless
/// everything is hard-coded you wind up with a ton of properties to configure.
///
/// Alternatively, you can have something like `let stateImages: StateImageMap`â€”with `StateImageMap`
/// a typealias for the more-verbose true type nameâ€”and then just do `self.stateImages[self.state]`
/// where you need it.
